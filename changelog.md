## Releases

### 1.1.0-beta.2 - 2026-03-03

#### Highlights

- Major Phase 2 refactor release focused on splitting monolithic core responsibilities into PSR-4 services, while preserving existing runtime behavior and public API contracts.
- Core architecture is now significantly more modular across bootstrap, onboarding, settings, admin workflows, migration flows, diagnostics, competition rule handling, and frontend assets pipeline.
- Public integration surfaces remain stable (`opentt_*` shortcodes, admin actions, option/meta namespaces, DB compatibility behavior).

#### Engineering

- Added refactor compatibility contract documentation: `docs/refactor/API_CONTRACT.md`.
- Introduced Composer PSR-4 foundation and namespaced plugin bootstrap with safe non-Composer autoload fallback.
- Extracted infrastructure services for DB table resolution, admin UI translation, and visual settings CSS/settings domain.
- Extracted WordPress service layer for legacy content and shortcode registration, onboarding/rewrite lifecycle, settings and notices, league/season and competition admin flows, migration and maintenance actions, and competition rule storage/catalog/profile/query helpers.

#### Assets & UI

- Migrated frontend/admin selector namespace to `opentt-*` and aligned JS bindings.
- Standardized key admin JS microcopy to English.

- Added physical DB table migration script: `migrations/2026-03-03-db-tables-stkb-to-opentt.sql`.
- Added runtime DB table resolver (`OpenTT_Unified_Core::db_table`) with legacy fallback.
- Added automatic legacy row sync from `stkb_*` tables to `opentt_*` tables during bootstrap/schema migration.

#### Documentation
